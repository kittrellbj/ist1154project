                <h1>Welcome to My Profile</h1>
                <p>My name is Brian Kittrell, and this website is a project for my IST-1154 Web &amp; Programming Concepts course. Our assignment was to create a basic website with HTML and CSS and make a short video demonstrating it for our class. If you open developer mode (F12 in Chrome), you can see the code and styles that make up this page.</p>
                <h2>What Can I Do Here?</h2>                
                <p>At the top left, you will see which page you are on in large letters. Along the top of the page, you will see various links: </p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a> returns you to this page.</li>
                        <li><a href="hobbies.html">Hobbies</a> will bring up the page where I discuss some of my hobbies.</li>
                        <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a> lists a few of my other projects, websites, and undertakings.</li>
                        <li><a href="courses.html">Courses</a> brings up my course listings and other college information.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>On the right of each page, there is a sidebar which holds extra or summary information. On this page, it has a little basic information and my picture.</p>
                <h2>Thanks For Coming By!</h2>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my page and checking things out. I hope it was enjoyable.</p>
