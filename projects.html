                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>When I'm not at work at my job or handling family stuff, I'll work on my projects or pursue <a href="hobbies.html">hobbies</a>. In general, hobbies are things I do completely for enjoyment, and projects are things that I do which either have some commercial value or represent marketable skills for resume purposes. Links to my main projects appear on the right.</p>
                <p>GitHub is where I upload all of my code, from simple code examples in different languages to full-fledged projects. If you haven't already, I recommend that you create a GitHub account and upload your code projects there, especially if you're pursuing a programming or software engineering degree. It will establish a baseline of experience that employers can (and often do) explore in the interview and hiring process.</p>
                <p>Late Nite Books is my DBA (doing business as) publishing company. I have written and published seven novels, some short stories, and omnibus collections through my imprint. Every once in a while, someone enjoys reading them. Hundreds of thousands of readers all over the world have downloaded my ebooks, listened to my audiobooks, or purchased the printed copies.</p>
                <p>ProofMicro is a project that is still in the planning phases (as of 9/16/2021), so its page will only take you to a temporary default page generated by the web service on my server. The idea is to provide a service for proofreading which takes a source document (manuscript, long-form text, or really anything you want), splits it into segments, and serves each segement to the proofreader while allowing the proofreader to make changes to the segment. Think "proofreading flashcards" and you'll basically have the idea. I was working on the project a lot prior to re-entering college, but since I've been in college with a heavy course load, I have put it on pause for now. Hopefully, I can launch it by next year.</p>
                <p>Aside from those projects you can access via the web, I also do a considerable amount of IT freelancing. Sometimes it is project consultation, sometimes development and coding, and sometimes troubleshooting PCs and networks for issues. I'm sure many of you have plenty of people who rely on you for technical questions and solutions to their everyday problems by virtue of being "the computer whiz" they know.</p>
