            <div class="main">
                <h2>Playing Video Games</h2>
                <p>I play a lot of video games, and most of the time, it's on PC. Some of my favorite games are Red Dead Redemption II, Grand Theft Auto V, State of Decay 2, the Fallout series, the Elder Scrolls series, and others.</p>

                <h2>Traveling</h2>
                <p>Traveling has always been something I've enjoyed. Some of the trips I remember most are the ones to Washington, D.C.; Denver, Colorado; and Austin, Texas. Usually, we will drive if the destination is 8 hours or less and fly if it's more than 8 hours by car.</p>

                <h2>Cooking Out</h2>
                <p>I do a lot of grilling, and I really enjoy it when I'm in the mood to cook out. Usually, my desire to cook out is directly proportional to how hot it is outside at the time. I like grilling ribs, chicken, steak, and vegetables, and I've been mocked on Facebook for the cooking I perform in an air fryer. (Have you ever cooked a whole rack of ribs in an air fryer? You should try it.)</p>

                <h2>Home Improvement</h2>
                <p>I enjoy aspects of home improvement to enough of a degree to do my own carpentry work, tile laying, light electrical repair, drywall repair, building fences, and all other manner of similar work. Recently, we put in two French drains around the house to reduce the risk of water leaks and damage to the house. There's always work to be done in this arena.</p>

                <h2>Spending Time with Family</h2>
                <p>As a family, we love going out for dinner, shopping, and entertainment. Sometimes we meet up with my wife's or my parents and spend a bit of time taking on some sort of activity like cooking out, going out to a movie, and more.</p>
                
                <h2>Spending Time with My Dog</h2>
                <p>What once was my kids' puppy has, in two years, transformed into my dog. He is a brindle mix of (we believe) Boxer and Pittbull or something along those lines. Sometimes we sit together and take a nap or watch a movie. Other times we are in the backyard where he attempts a dramatic escape through the neighbor's 20-year-old fence to visit the other dogs in the neighborhood. He's a mess, but we love him.</p>
