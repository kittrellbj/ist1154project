---Overall Site Plan---

I'll have an index.html page to display a small introduction and explain the links in the navigation. I'm envisioning a two-column layout for the whole page split about 75%/25% left to right. Probably blue, white, and grays as the color theme.

Directory/file structure:
home/
├── css/
│   └ syles.css
├── img/
│   ├ mainphoto.jpg
│   ├ hobbyphoto[1...].jpg
│   └ projectphoto[1...].jpg
├ index.html 
├ resume.html 
├ hobbies.html 
├ projects.html 
└ contact.html 

Page descriptions:
- index.html - main home page. Explain other links in brief.
- resume.html - resume information.
- hobbies.html - descriptions and photos of hobbies.
- projects.html - descriptions and photos of projects. Links to relevant project websites.
- contact.html - web-safe (public facing) contact information.

Other considerations:

I'm thinking of a little basic gradient animation in the body background and probably some sans-serif Google webfonts. Big, blocky letters for headings and a sharp, clean sans font for text. Full-justified text to square out the elements might look nice, but I'll experiment.
